# Oogway - Medical Application
## Introduction

Oogway is an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system designed to
streamline the process for doctors and patients alike.

Oogway is similar to the following EMR systems:
- Epic
- Cerner
- Allscripts
- Meditech
- AthenaHealth

These EMR systems have the following features in common:
- Electronic Health Record (EHR) Functionality
- Clinical Documentation
- Interoperability
- Security and Compliance

To complete their tasks, they rely on the following technologies:
- Database Management Systems
- Web Technologies
- Health Level Seven (HL7)
- Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)
- OAuth and OpenID Connect
- RESTful APIs
- Health Information Exchange (HIE) Standards
- Encryption and Secure Communication Protocols
- Cloud Computing Infrastructure

Oogway is composed of the following three interacting systems which
are built using the listed technologies:
- A Native Desktop Client for Doctors and other Authorized Medical
  Professionals can use under HIPAA compliance
  - C++
  - Qt
  - SQLite3
  - libcurl
  - GPG
- A Mobile Client for Patients can use under HIPAA compliance
  - Java
  - Android
- A Web Server with a RESTful API that 
  - JavaScript
  - Node
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB

## Project Overview

Describes the purpose and goals of the project, including its target
audience, intended platform(s), and any specific requirements or
constraints.


The purpose of this project is to create a distributed system that
decreases friction between the patient and the medical professional.

The medical professional needs to be able to review everything that is
relevant to the client's condition in order to address it in a
time-efficient manner.
